  "You have the right to perform your actions, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions.",

  "You have control over doing your respective duty only, but no control or claim over the results. The fruits of work should not be your motive; you should never be inactive.",
  "Those who possess this wisdom have equal regard for all. They see the same Self in a spiritual aspirant and an outcaste, in an elephant, a cow, and a dog.",
  "The happiness which comes from long practice, which leads to the end of suffering, which at first is like poison, but at last like nectar—this kind of happiness arises from the serenity of one's own mind.",
